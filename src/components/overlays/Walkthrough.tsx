/**
 * The first run, once, per account.
 *
 * One page, three choices, all of which already have a defensible answer set —
 * so this is a greeting that happens to be adjustable rather than a form
 * standing between somebody and their tasks. Nothing here has to be answered
 * for the app to work, and all three live in Settings afterwards.
 *
 * They are on one page rather than three because they are one decision: what
 * the thing should look like. Paging through them made a four-click ceremony
 * out of a question you can answer by glancing at it, and the shape of the
 * week — which is about how you work rather than how it looks — did not belong
 * in a first run at all. It is in Settings, where it is found when it is
 * wanted rather than asked before anyone knows what it means.
 *
 * Each choice takes effect the moment it is made, on the app behind the
 * dialog as well as inside it. That is the whole argument for doing this at
 * all: a colour named in a list is a guess, and a colour applied to the page
 * you are about to use is an answer.
 *
 * The settings are written immediately; the *record of having been asked* is
 * written by Start or by Skip. Closing the window means being asked again
 * rather than silently never being asked.
 *
 * On a phone it is one choice, not three. Three grids of cards on a 375px
 * screen is a page and a half of scrolling before anyone has seen a task —
 * which is a form standing between somebody and their work, the one thing
 * this was written not to be. Light or dark is worth asking because it is the
 * choice a phone gets wrong most often and the one nobody thinks to go
 * looking for; the accent and the density are a pleasure to find later, in
 * Settings, where both still are.
